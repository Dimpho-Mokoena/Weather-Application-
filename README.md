# Weather-Application-
This is a simple, straight forward weather application written in HTML, CSS and Javascript 
Basics of Javascript were incorporated on the app
The application does not use real live data, however it prompts you to key in your current city as well as temperature and it syncs with the inputed data
Data chages with the Rainy and Sunny emojis
